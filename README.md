# Long-read Nextflow Processing Pipeline

A modular Nextflow pipeline for processing long-read sequencing data (POD5/FASTQ) and generating taxonomic profiles using Kraken.

This pipeline is designed to be reusable across environmental and biological datasets.
An example application is environmental DNA analysis in freshwater mussel samples.

## Features
- Modular Nextflow DSL2 structure
- Long-read preprocessing
- Taxonomic profiling
- Reproducible and portable workflows
